## Inventory Draft
1. Components
   1. source code
      1. first-party
         1. 2 repositories: 
            1. frontend: https://github.com/Lab-Lab-Lab/CPR-Music
               1. NextJS (built on top of React), with NextAuth, redux, tanstack-query
            2. backend: https://github.com/Lab-Lab-Lab/CPR-Music-Backend
               1. Django (with Django rest framework)
      2. third-party
         1. backend: (python) pip packages
         2. frontend: (nodejs) npm packages
         3. for the UX we depend on Flat.io for rendering a music score in the browser and for providing an in-browser score composing tool ("editor")
   2. deployment
      1. recently setup continuous deployment: 
         1. commits/pull requests merged to the dev branch will be deployed to 
            1. frontend (Lab-Lab-Lab/CPR-Music): dev.musiccpr.org
            2. backend (Lab-Lab-Lab/CPR-Music-Backend): dev-api.musiccpr.org
         2. 1. commits/pull requests merged to the main branch will be deployed to 
            1. frontend (Lab-Lab-Lab/CPR-Music): musiccpr.org
            2. backend (Lab-Lab-Lab/CPR-Music-Backend): api.musiccpr.org
      2. AWS
         1. 1 ec2 instance hosts both "dev" and "prod" (us-east-2 [ohio])
         2. 2 RDS instances (both postgres) (us-east-2 [ohio])
            1. dev
            2. prod
         3. 2 s3 buckets 
            1. dev-api-musiccpr
            2. api-musiccpr-prod
         4. SES 2 identities (us-east-2 [ohio])
            1. musiccpr.org (domain)
            2. aws@musiccpr.org (email address)
         5. IAM
            1. User Groups (2)
            2. Users (6)
            3. Roles (9)
2. Processes
   1. continuous deployment
   2. how we onboard developers
   3. how we onboard new research subjects (teachers)
   4. how we export/analyze data (for research and eventual publication)
   5. demo users that exist in dev as well as prod and what their access is?
      1. application users (MusicCPR) (ok to have demo users, but not if they have access to prod data bc demo users' default passwords are documented in public source code)

# Action Items
1. Document an inventory of components and processes that compose the web application
2. Determine how widespread use and integration of keys are
   1. vague recollection from recent attempt to comply with demand to rotate keys
      1. key is (ONLY?) in environment variable on the server
3. JT: look into asset discovery/inventory type templates/tools
4. AWS best practices tasks
   1. Stewart logging in with some root user thing instead of IAM User (the preference of AWS for better security)
